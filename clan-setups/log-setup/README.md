# ðŸ“„Log Setup

## One Command To Set Them All - /set log add

Yup! to set up any of the logs, all you need is `/set log add`. All you need to fill in is the clan field with the clan you want to set some logs up for.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The channel field on any of the setup commands is optional. If you don't set it, it will use the channel the command was run in! The more you know :)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Log Types

* Clan Capital Log - Logs all clan capital donations & raids. **Cannot** show where the gold was donated (not given by the API)
* Join Leave Log - Log of Clan Member Joins & Leaves

{% hint style="info" %}
A unique feature of this Join/Leave log is that is shows _where_ the player goes after they leave. Helpful if you need to see if they moved to another family clan or maybe went to a rival?!
{% endhint %}

* War Log - Shows War Start, End, Prep, Attacks, & Missed Hits along with a Result Overview. For more difference between the two types - Panel & Continuous, reference [here](war-log-differences.md).&#x20;
* Legend Log - Log of each legend attack & defense done in your clan
* Clan Log - Log of clan member upgrades (spell, hero, pet, troop, sieges & TH) along with Name & Trophy League Changes
* Donation Log - Log of donations given & received in the clan (cannot show which troops were donated, not given by API)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The logs update approximately every 5 minutes. This value may go down in the future but never significantly higher.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are curious what these logs look like, they are all on demo in the [support server.](https://discord.gg/clashking)
