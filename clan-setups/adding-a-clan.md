# ⚙️ Adding a Clan

Assuming you have added the bot to your server, to Add a Clan you just need one command - `/addclan` \
\
**Inside this slash command there are 5 fields:**

<details>

<summary>clan_tag</summary>

This is the unique tag used to identify a clan. It can be found in-game underneath the clan name. (pic below as an example)

<summary>category</summary>

This is a way to organize your clans. Many clan families have 5 or more clans. Sometimes some are only for CWL or Event clans. You can use one of the preset options (pictured) or type your own.

<summary>member_role &#x26; leadership_role</summary>

These two are best explained together. The very core of the bot is about family management, specifically roles. This has been here since the beginning. You may or may not use it, but I have made it mandatory on setup to introduce it and have it ready if you do decide to use the very handy role management that ClashKing provides.\
\
_Member Role_ is the role that the members of this clan should receive. So on your discord, if the bot managed the roles, every person in this clan would get this role. Helpful if you are making clan specific channels.\
\
_Leadership Role_ is the role that any co-leaders & leader in this clan will receive. In a typical discord, you might have a lead chat for a clan or cumulative leader chat for all clans - this role may find use here.\
\
Typical/suggested naming is something like _@Clan Members_ and _@Clan Leadership_\
\
You may be wondering why there is no elder role, and co-leader/leader is "merged". We'll get into that in the Eval Portion of this guide.

<details>

<summary>clan_channel</summary>

Goal of this setup is to get a few channels & roles set up for your server. So here we need a clan channel, where you would probably put the people from the previous general\_clan\_role into. Or in other words, a channel where you clan members would go.\
\
Why? What does this do? The bot sends ban alerts for your clan & link welcome messages. It's not spammy whatsoever.

</details>

After filling these in, you should get a success message showing what you have set up. \
You can continue with setting up some logs or other setups, but this alone will let you use a large portion of the "static" commands & will start tracking wars, donations, activity & more for your clan!
