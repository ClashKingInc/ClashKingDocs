# ðŸ“„ Log Setup

## One Command To Set Them All - /setup logs

Yup! to set up any of the logs, all you need is `/setup logs`. All you need to fill in is the clan field with the clan you want to set some logs up for and the `mode` -> Add/Edit or Remove.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The channel field on any of the setup commands is optional. If you don't set a specific channel, ClashKing will use the channel the command was run in! The more you know :)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Log Types

{% hint style="info" %}
Note these options will be slightly different in the command, i.e Join/Leave Log is actually 2 logs. You can choose to set up either or both.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary><strong>Clan Capital Log</strong></summary>

Logs all clan capital donations & raids. It **cannot** show where the gold was donated unfortunately (not given by the API).

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Join/Leave Log</strong></summary>

&#x20;Log of Clan Member Joins & Leaves

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
A unique feature of this Join/Leave log is that it shows _where_ the player goes after they leave. Helpful if you need to see if a member moved to another family clan or maybe went to a rival?!
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary><strong>War Log/Panel</strong></summary>

Shows War Start, End, Prep, Attacks, & Missed Hits along with a Result Overview. _Panel_ sends one message and then updates it as the war goes along. _Log_ sends a message for every attack and event in the war.&#x20;
