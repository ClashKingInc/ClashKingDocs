# ðŸ“„ Log Setup

## One Command To Set Them All - /setup logs

Yup! to set up any of the logs, all you need is `/setup logs`. All you need to fill in is the clan field with the clan you want to set some logs up for and the `mode` -> Add/Edit or Remove.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The channel field on any of the setup commands is optional. If you don't set a specific channel, ClashKing will use the channel the command was run in! The more you know :)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Log Types

{% hint style="info" %}
Note these options will be slightly different in the command, i.e Join/Leave Log is actually 2 logs. You can choose to set up either or both.
{% endhint %}

* **Clan Capital Log** - Logs all clan capital donations & raids. It **cannot** show where the gold was donated unfortunately (not given by the API)
* **Join/Leave Log** - Log of Clan Member Joins & Leaves

{% hint style="info" %}
A unique feature of this Join/Leave log is that it shows _where_ the player goes after they leave. Helpful if you need to see if a member moved to another family clan or maybe went to a rival?!
{% endhint %}

* **War Log/Panel** - Shows War Start, End, Prep, Attacks, & Missed Hits along with a Result Overview. _Panel_ sends one message and then updates it as the war goes along. _Log_ sends a message for every attack and event in the war.&#x20;
* **Legend Log** - Log of each legend attack & defense done in your clan
* **Clan Log** - Log of clan member upgrades (spell, hero, pet, troop, sieges & TH) along with Name & Trophy League Changes
* **Donation Log** - Log of donations given & received in the clan. It **cannot** show which troops were donated (not given by API)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The logs update approximately every 5-10 minutes. This value may go down in the future but is never significantly higher.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are curious what these logs look like, they are all on demo in the [support server.](https://discord.gg/clashking)
{% endhint %}

### To Remove Logs - /set log remove
