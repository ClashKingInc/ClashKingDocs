# üñºÔ∏è Base links

## The goal

Sometimes you would like to share a base with your clanmates, and you maybe even have a specific channel to store them. But reading a link does not provide any infos on what's the content of it. We provide a way to show more infos on this content !

People can then download the base & give feedbacks. Keep a track on how many people downloaded your base!

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also turn on [link-parse.md](../server-setups/link-parse.md "mention") so the messages containing a base link will be automaticlly replaced by the embed.
{% endhint %}
