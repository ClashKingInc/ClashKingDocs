# ðŸ”˜ Buttons

The `/button` command allows you to add buttons under an embed.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not know what is an embed and how to create one, please take a look at [embeds.md](embeds.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

Thanks to that, you can use a command without writing it.

You can add up to 4 buttons under one embed among 5 choices :&#x20;
