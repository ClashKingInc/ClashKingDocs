# Army links

## The goal

Sometimes you would like to share an army with your clanmates, and you maybe even have a specific channel to store them. But reading a link does not provide any infos on what's the content of it. We provide a way to show more infos on this content !

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also turn on [link-parse.md](../server-setups/link-parse.md "mention") so the messages containing an army link will be automaticlly replaced by the embed (without nicknames and clan castle)
{% endhint %}
