# ðŸŽ« Inside the Ticket

## Ticket Messages

This is a new feature & one of my favorite. Sometimes you have messages you repeat over & over to ticket applicants, like maybe (on a basic scale) "Here is Clan A, and this is the link to join it..."\
\
Well, now you can automate that, and it supports replacement conventions! Here are the available options:

<details>

<summary>Replacement Convention Options</summary>

* {ticket\_count}
* {ticket\_status}
* {ticket\_emoji\_status}
* {ticket\_channel\_mention}
* {user\_name}
* {user\_mention}
* {server\_name}
* {server\_member\_count}
* {account\_name}
* {account\_th}
* {account\_heroes}
* {clan\_name}
* {clan\_level}
* {clan\_badge\_emoji}
* {clan\_link}
* {clan\_location}
* {clan\_member\_count}
* {clan\_leader}
* {clan\_leader\_mention}
* {clan\_tag}
* {clan\_war\_league}
* {clan\_capital\_league}

</details>

{% hint style="info" %}
The replacement conventions with "clan" in the name, will require the "Set Clan" button to be used, so it knows what clan it is dealing with
{% endhint %}
