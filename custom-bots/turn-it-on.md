# ðŸŸ¢ Turn it on!

So if you are here, you should have done everything in the [Developer Portal](developer-portal.md) Guide and should have your bot token and bot invite link (don't use this just _yet_).\
\
Now head back to discord, in a channel where you can run ClashKing commands, use `/setup custom-bot`. This has 2 options.

* name: this is just a name for identification purposes, make it something memorable, so if you need me to look at the custom bot "coolbot9000" i can do that, it won't change the name you set on the bot earlier.
* bot\_token: this is that token from the earlier setup you should have saved

Fill in both fields, run the command, and you should get a message like&#x20;

```
"Bot created, will be online shortly"
```

Now you can invite your bot. Use the invite link you saved from earlier. By clicking on it, you can invite it to your server like other bots.\


If you decide to change the name of profile picture of your bot, you can do that the same way you set them initially.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not put 2 ClashKing custom bots in one server. It will not be pretty. However having the main ClashKing bot and your custom version is definitely alright, and I would even maybe encourage it if it doesn't bother anything.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The bot will take a few minutes to initialize, creating emojis and the such. So if you want to wait to invite the bot after 10 minutes after creating, that is alright
{% endhint %}
