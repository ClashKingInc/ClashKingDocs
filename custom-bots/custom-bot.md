# ðŸ¤– Custom bot

## What is a custom bot?

A custom bot is a bot that functions like the ClashKing bot, but you can rename it and change its profile picture.



## Who can get a custom bot?

Anyone with a server that has more than 250 members and 2+ clans. If you don't meet those requirements, you can subscribe on our Discord server (starting at $2.99 a month), which will unlock the custom bot for you, regardless of your server's member count and clans.



## **How do I set it up?**

Follow the step in [developer-portal.md](developer-portal.md "mention"). If you have any problems during the setup, please contact us on [Discord](https://invite.clashk.ing/).
