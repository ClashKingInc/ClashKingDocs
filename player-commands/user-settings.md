* `{default_main_account}` make you choose which account will be display first when you run a specific command (for example `/player lookup`).
* `{server_main_account}` make you choose which account will be display first when you run a specific command **but only in the current server** (for example `/player lookup`).
* `{private_mode}` : if you want to be a ninja (no use at the moment).
