# üîç Lookup

`/player lookup` allows you to see basic stats of a player profile.

**There are 2 parameters :**&#x20;

* `{player}` which is the player tag of the account you want to lookup
* `{discord_user}` which is the discord username of the user you want to lookup.

If you do not enter any parameters, it will show your best account overview.
