# Voice Statbars

Ever wonder when the next clash event is? Well while you are in your server, tell easily with voice statbars (I know not the best name). Best way to think of them is as countdown timers using discord voice channels. They are easy to set up - just use `/voice-statbar` and choose the type you would like. There is 4 types, all pictured below.

A couple of notes:

* The bot requires admin for this, due to the fact of creating & setting permissions for the @everyone role.
* They update every 10 minutes
* If a pipe -> `|` is added anything before it will stay, like in the example above to add a sword emoji
