# üéôÔ∏è Voice Countdowns

## The goal

Ever wonder when the next clash event is? Your server members will be able to tell easily with voice countdowns! Best way to think of them are timers, by using discord voice channels.&#x20;

## The command

They are easy to set up - just use `/setup countdowns` and choose the types you would like. There are 5 types, all pictured below.

{% hint style="info" %}
A couple of notes:

* The bot requires admin for this, due to the fact of creating and setting permissions for the _@everyone_ role.
* They update every 10 minutes
* If a pipe -> `|` is added anything before it will stay, like the added sword emoji in the CWL example above
{% endhint %}

### The parameters

### Optional

`clan`: if you want to set specific countdowns for a clan (war score and timer)
