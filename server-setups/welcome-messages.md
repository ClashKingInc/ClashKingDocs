## Welcome Link

One of the main pains of managing a clash discord server, is linking people. Linking comes with many benefits like seeing who in-game is who on discord or role management, but there is often cumbersome commands or confused people. That is where `/welcome-link set` comes in.\
On every new join to your server, it will send this message & button pictured -> ![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/923767060977303552/1059704405030617170/image.png)\
No more commands, no more doing it manually, & no more needing to type out instructions. They press the button & it opens a form asking for their tag & api token (optionally, this can be turned off with the `api_token` field in the command)\
