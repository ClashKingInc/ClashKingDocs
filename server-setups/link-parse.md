# üèπ Link parse

## The goal

You can configure link parsing so that every message containing a link will be replaced with visual embeds, allowing you to see exactly what each link contains. To do this, use the `/setup link-parse` command.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also do it manually for army links and base links (see [army-links.md](../utility/army-links.md "mention"))
{% endhint %}

## The command

`/setup link-parse`

## The Parameters

### Optional

* `{army_links}`: replace the army link by an embed.
* `{player_links}`: replace the player link by an embed.&#x20;
* `{clan_links}`: replace the clan link by an embed.&#x20;
* `{base_links}`: replace the base link with an embed. This requires an image and optionally a description text.
* `{show_parse}`: if turned on, it allows you to use -show PartOfTheNameOfOneOfYourClans to see an overview of this clan.
* `{manage_whitelist}`:  disable the link-parsing in certain channels.

<summary>Base links</summary>

Do you have a great base you'd like to share? Simply post a picture of the base along with the base link in a single message. Link parsing will transform it into a message, as shown in the example below. You can also include regular text in the message to appear above the embed, for example, mentioning the required Clan Castle defense!

You can also use the [/base](../utility/base-links.md) command for creating such embeds!&#x20;

Base links will remain active for 90 days from the date of the last click.
