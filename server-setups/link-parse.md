# üèπ Link parse

You can configure link parsing so that links are replaced with visual embeds, allowing you to see exactly what each link contains. To do this, use the `/setup link-parse` command.

**There are up to 5 parameters that you can set to on/off :**&#x20;

* `{army_links}` : replace the army link by an embed. Can be used with [#army-link](link-parse.md#army-link "mention")if turned off.
* `{player_links}` : replace the player link by an embed.&#x20;
* `{clan_links}` : replace the clan link by an embed.&#x20;
* `{base_links}` : replace the base link by an embed. Can be used with [#base-base\_link-description-photo](link-parse.md#base-base\_link-description-photo "mention") if turned off.
* `{show_parse}` : if turned on, it allows you to use -show PartOfTheNameOfOneOfYourClans to see an overview of this clan.
