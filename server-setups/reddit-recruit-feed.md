# Reddit Recruit Feed

One of my favorite commands when I ran a clan. Reddit is one of the main 2 or 3 external recruiting sources for Clash of Clans. For anyone unfamiliar, there is a subreddit - r/clashofclansrecruit - where people post when they are looking for a clan. This feed will post & optionally ping a role when this happens. This let's you get a leg up & be one of the first to message or comment on a user's post which can significantly boost your recruiting chances, all thing considered.

{% hint style="info" %}
Sometimes a post may be sent in the feed twice. This is mitigated but appears to be an issue with the Reddit API
{% endhint %}

To add this feed -> `/set reddit-recruit-feed` To Remove - use the `remove` flag in the same command. Below is an example of a feed post.
