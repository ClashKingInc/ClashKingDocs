# Reddit Recruit Feed

One of my favorite commands when I ran a clan. Reddit is one of the main 2 or 3 external recruiting sources for Clash of Clans. For anyone unfamiliar, there is a subreddit - [r/clashofclansrecruit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClansRecruit/) - where people post when they are looking for a clan. This feed will post & optionally ping a role when this happens. This let's you get a leg up & be one of the first to message or comment on a user's post which can significantly boost your recruiting chances, all things considered.

To add this feed -> `/setup reddit-recruit-feed` & to remove - use the `remove` flag in the same command. Below is an example of a feed post.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Player Profile Button pops up when a "recruit" has shared their player tag & the bot provides a quick way to view their account details
{% endhint %}
