Once in, you'll be able to select several filters, any custom text, and for which clans you want reminders to be sent/pinged. \


### /reminders edit

Starts off by having you choose a clan + reminder group to edit (war, capital, etc). Once you choose, you'll be greeted by

From here you can choose the individual reminder to edit and you'll be able to do the same filters you did when you created the reminder - or delete it if you choose.
