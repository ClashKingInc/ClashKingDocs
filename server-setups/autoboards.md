# üèóÔ∏è Autoboards

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is currently in **BETA**. We need to activate it on your server before you can use it. If you're interested in trying it out, you can request access in the **Discord** [**support**](https://discord.com/channels/923764211845312533/923786531876003850) **channel**. To activate it, we will need your **server ID** or **server name**.
{% endhint %}

## The goal

Autoboards are commands that are automatically triggered at a specific time of the day or during an event of the season.

{% hint style="info" %}
Here are the currently available commands:

* /legends clan
* /clan search
* /clan compo
* /clan donations
* /clan activity
* /clan capital
* /family clans

More commands will be added in the future, so feel free to suggest new ones!
{% endhint %}

### How to set it up

1. First, run the command you want to automate. For example: `/legends clan`.

#### Auto Post

A message will be sent at the specific time you choose. You can select particular days of the week or trigger it during events like **End of Season**.

Once set, the command will automatically run in the channel where you configured the Autoboard at the scheduled time. For example, if you choose **End of Season**, the following message will automatically be sent at **5 AM UTC**:

{% hint style="warning" %}
There is currently no way to remove the Auto Post of autoboard with automation. A command will be added later. You can ask to remove an Auto Post automation in the discord support server.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



#### Auto Refresh

An embed message will be sent and automatically refreshed every **30 to 60 minutes**. You‚Äôll also see a timestamp at the bottom indicating when it was last updated.
