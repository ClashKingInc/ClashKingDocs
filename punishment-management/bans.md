# ðŸšª Bans

The ban command can be very useful to create a list of members that you would not want to return for eternity or a given time period.

To add a user to the list use `/ban add {tag}` (this supports "smart search" so a username can work). There are two optional fields `{reason}` and `{rollover_days}`. Roll over days is the period which the ban lasts and will auto delete after it has passed.

All bans can be viewed using `/ban list`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Using the ban command will not ban them from joining your clan. This is out of the bots control.
