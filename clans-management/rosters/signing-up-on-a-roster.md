Your clan leaders dropped a roster sign up pannel? It's time to sign up!

On the pannel, you'll see :&#x20;

* The name of the roster,&#x20;
* The start date of the event or the registration deadline,&#x20;
* The different groups available,&#x20;
* The town hall level requirements,
* The number of player that can register.

Let's learn how to interact with this pannel!

## Sign up

To sign up, you firstly need to touch the "<mark style="color:green;">Join</mark>" button.

Once you clicked on it, ClashKing Bot will send a message **on the bottom** of the channel, which will allow you to choose one or several account to add.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Only the accounts that fit the requirements of the roster will be shown in the list. Those requirements are set by your clan leaders and are visible at the bottom of the roster.<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png" alt="" data-size="original">
{% endhint %}

You can also choose a group you want to sign up in. For example, you could have a "Main Group" and a "Sub group". Except for "Main Group", all those groups are created by your clan leaders, so feel free to ask them about those groups.

Once you click on submit, you must have a confirmation message.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once you registered, your name MUST appear on the roster list. If it doesn't, use the refresh (üîÑ) button. If it still doesn't, then try register again, or ask your clan staff for help.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can be registered on several rosters at the same time, so be careful not to register for two events that happen at the same time!
{% endhint %}

## Unregister

You changed your mind and don't want to participate? You can easily unregister your account with the "<mark style="color:red;">Remove</mark>" button.
