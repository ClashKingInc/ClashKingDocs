# ‚ùì Missing players

## The goal

A very useful command that allow you to see who's missing in the clan compared to a specific roster, who is in the clan but isn't registered, and even ping those people!

You can then spot & ping people who forgot to register, or who are still not in the right clan before your event start.

## The command

* `roster`: name of the roster you want to check players
* `message`: Message that will be sent if you decide to ping the players
* `reverse:` if set to true, it will show the list of people that are in the clan but are not on a roster tied to the clan. If set to false (which is the default value), it will show the list of the people that are on a roster tied to the clan but that aren't currently in the clan.

## Once sent

Once the command has been sent, you'll see the list of the player, but also a "Ping Misiing" button, which will ping the missing players with the message you set on the command.
