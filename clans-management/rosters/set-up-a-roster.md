# ⚙️ Set up a roster

## The goal

Once you created your roster ([create-a-roster.md](create-a-roster.md "mention")), you can set it up to add specific requirements, like requirements to sign on the roster.

## The commands

Firstly, you can create groups on which player will be able to choose (like a sub group for people who don't want to be on the main group) with `/roster groups.`

Use`/roster settings`. Once sent, the bot will send you a link to set up the roster on a webpage, which can't be done on Discord.
