# ðŸ‘€ View strikes

## The goal

You might be upset by a member who seems to repetedly not follow the clan rules. By viewing the strikes, you can have a summary of everything that have been reproached to them.

## The command

There are lots of customisable ways to view strikes but all start with the base command `/strike list` .

## The parameters

### Required

* `view`: It has 2 options, player and strike. Player will show a list of accounts with strikes and then a list of the strikes they have. Where as strike will show a detailed list of strikes individually. Images bellow display difference.
