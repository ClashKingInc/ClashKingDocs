# Basic Eval (Clan Roles)

There are 3 primary eval commands -> `/eval user`, `/eval role` and `/eval tag.`\
Eval is the role management system for this bot & those 3 are "tiers" of evaling, where user is one discord user, role is every discord user in a role, and tag is a single clash player.&#x20;

### But what does it do?

As mentioned, role management. Whenever you add a clan, you have to add \*_at minimum_\* a member role. So in that case when you run eval, those who are in the clan & on discord will receive that member role (provided their clash account is linked to their discord). \
\
\- member role: given to every member in the clan\
\- leadership role: give to coleaders & leader of the clan\

What about elder? Unfortunately I have no plans to support an elder role at the moment, it provides little benefit as a discord role.
