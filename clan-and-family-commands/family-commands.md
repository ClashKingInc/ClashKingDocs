# üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Family Commands

Family commands are very similar to Clan commands but on a larger scale being able to view the entire family of clans on your server.

## Top 50s

There are a couple different options that you are able to view the top 50 members in the entire family for which can be helpful for friendly competition.

**There is up to 6 parameters :**&#x20;

* {`season}`  behave slightly differently for each command. Season an refer to month (clan games) or the ingame season (donations), raid weekends also have `{weekend}` instead.
* `{limit}` will only show that number of users
* `{townhall}` will only show results at that townhall
* `{sort_by}` allows you to choose which parameters should be taken in account to make the top 50
* `{sort_order}` will show the result by ascending or descending order
* `{server}` will shows the result for a family linked to a specific server **you are in**.
