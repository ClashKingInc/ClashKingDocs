# Family Commands

Family commands are very similar to Clan commands but on a larger scale being able to view the entire family of clans on your server. Most of the family commands have the `{server}` option to select other servers - I wont mention this for every command as it does the same thing.

<summary><code>/family clans</code></summary>

This will show a general members count for all clans as well as the league in the server. `{server}` can be used to check other servers you are in
