If you want to have graphical representation of the results of the commands in [clan-commands.md](clan-commands.md "mention") and [family-commands.md](family-commands.md "mention"), you can use the `/graph` commands

**You have the choice between :**&#x20;

* `/graph daily` : Loot, Upgrades, Activity, Roles, Names, League, Exp Level, Defenses Wins, Caln Capital Contribution, Clan, War Preference & Best trophies
* /`graph over-time` : Activity, Clan Games, Attack Wins, Donations, Received, CWL Leagues, Capital Leagues & Capital Trophies
* `/graph month` : Compare clans to a daily attribute .
